    <ul>
      <li><strong>JUL 6, 1907</strong> - Born in Coyoacán, Mexico. </li>

        <strong>OCT 22, 1913</strong> - At age 6, Frida was struck with polio affecting the use of her right leg. Her leg grew very thin, and her foot was stunted in its growth.She was cruelly nicknamed "peg-leg Frida" by her childhood classmates.

      <li>
        <strong>AUG 1, 1922</strong> - Frida commutes to Mexico City to begin classes at the National Preparatory School. Frida is one of only 35 girls to attend the prestigious school with hopes of becoming a doctor. At this point in her life she has no interest in pursuing a career as an artist.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SEP 17, 1925</strong> - Considered one of Mexico's greatest artists, she began painting at the age of 18 after she was severely injured in a bus accident in September 1925. Her injuries included a broken spinal column, collarbone, pelvis, and more. Though she recovered from the injuries and eventually regained her ability to walk, she remained in extreme pain for the rest of her life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AUG 21, 1929</strong> - While attending the National Preparatory School, Frida Kahlo met the artist Diego Rivera. On August 21, 1929, in a civil ceremony in the townhall of Coyoacán and wearing clothes borrowed from her maid, Frida Kahlo married Diego Rivera.Frida's mother did not approve of the union and did not attend the wedding ceremony. Frida's father was less resistant to the marriage and attended the ceremony.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oct 25, 1939</strong> - Her first painting is called The Two Fridas. It is made with oil on canvas. This large double self portrait by Frida Kahlo was painted around the time time of her divorce with the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. Kahlo wore her heart on her sleeve when she painted, in this case almost literally. In the Frida wearing a green dress, she holds a small portrait of Diego Rivera.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nov 6, 1939</strong> - Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo's divorce is finalized.

        <strong>Dec 8, 1940</strong> - Diego and Frida remarry. Their second marriage was as turbulent as the first. Their living quarters often were separate, although sometimes adjacent. She did not have any children with her husband.

      <li>
        <strong>Nov 1, 1941</strong> - The accident left her in a great deal of pain while she recovered in a full body cast; she painted to occupy her time during her temporary state of immobilization.

The maimed and bleeding body is assigned to the sun, which in Aztec mythology the sun is fed by sacrificial human blood. The other Frida, looking strong and optimistic, is assigned to the moon, a symbol of womanhood. In her hand she holds the corset that she has "Hope" of casting off forever after the surgery.
